% Thomas' Suggestions:
% - Add "executive summary" to aid CTOs reviewing CVs, detailiing:
%   - How I got to where I am now
%   - What I do right now.
%   - What my personal interests are for programming.
%   - Rename Systems Design to Systems Architecture

\section*{Skills and Experience}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Liveware Problems}, Co-Founder, \textbf{March 2020 {\textendash} Current}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Founded and started \href{https://haruspex.dev}{Haruspex} for insight
     into CI pipelines.
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ryte}, Backend Software Engineer, \textbf{May 2017 {\textendash} Sep 2019}
        \begin{itemize}

            \item Maintained a Scala web crawler central to the company,
              distributed over YARN and Flink, analyzed by a Scala service
              written in Spark. This system is running on AWS EMR, and was
              subsequently improved to support Javascript rendering and crawling
              single-page applications by controlling Chromium.
            \item Planned and implemented a personal development programme for
              engineering, involving space for self-directed learning,
              opportunity to conduct R\&D. This led to a number of useful tools
              being developed.
        \end{itemize}

\section*{Education}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Technical University of Munich}, Incomplete B.Sc. Computer Science,  (2016
    {\textendash} 2018)
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Programming Languages}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2.75cm} | p{14cm} }
Scala & Go-to language for implementing services, specifically the Akka ecosystem;
also possessing experience of the Typelevel family of libraries.\\
Python & Proficiency in building robust services and rapid prototyping \\
Elixir/OTP & Experience in building services for personal projects, and
connecting services in a reliable manner. Haruspex is built in Elixir.\\
Rust & Experience in creating CLI tools as well as agents/daemons for
metrics. Also created a desktop application using Rust such as
\href{https://github.com/mordecaimalignatus/rsass}{\tt rsass}. \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Technologies}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2.75cm} | p{14cm} }
Infrastructure & I use tools like Terraform and CloudFormation to
provision the infrastructure needed. \\
AWS & I have used Amazon Web Services to power large-scale crawlers and analysis
pipelines. \\
Databases & Primarily worked with PostgreSQL and variations of SQL
databases. In addition I also made heavy use of PrestoDB and DynamoDB.\\
Hadoop & Created and maintained applications on top of Apache Flink,
Apache Spark and YARN.\\
CI/CD & Experience in setting up the software, process and tooling needed
to continuously test and deploy services and products.\\
Containers & Experience in building and delivering containers, and orchestrating
them with ECS.
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Interests \& Focuses}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2.75cm} | p{14cm} }
  Observability & Modern, complex systems are hard to grasp and harder to change
  successfully, and so having insight into what is happening in production is
  invaluable. I build systems as transparent and observable as I
  can. \\
Systems Design \& Resilience & I design systems for failure, which results in simple,
but reliable architectures, easy to maintain and expand.\\
Tooling & I am very fond of having good tools to work with, and will create and
maintain tools that enable and simplify future changes. \\
