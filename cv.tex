% Thomas' Suggestions:
% - Add "executive summary" to aid CTOs reviewing CVs, detailiing:
%   - How I got to where I am now
%   - What I do right now.
%   - What my personal interests are for programming.
%   - Rename Systems Design to Systems Architecture

\item \textbf{Ryte}, Backend Software Engineer, \textbf{2017 {\textendash} present.}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Maintained a Scala web crawler central to the company,
              distributed over YARN and Flink, analyzed by a Scala service
              written in Spark. This system is running on AWS EMR, and was
              subsequently improved to support Javascript rendering and crawling
              single-page applications.
            \item Planned and implemented a personal development programme for
              engineering.

\subsection*{Programming Languages}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2.75cm} | p{14cm} }
Scala & Go-to language for implementing services, specifically the Akka ecosystem;
also possessing experience of the Typelevel family of libraries.\\
Python & Proficiency in building robust services and rapid prototyping,
basic experience in data science.\\
Elixir/OTP & Experience in building highly-available services to be used as
building blocks in an infrastructure; also some experience using Phoenix as
web-development backend.\\
Rust & Experience in creating CLI tools that do specific, small things well, as
well as agents/daemons for metrics. Also created a desktop application using
Rust and {\tt web-view} \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Technologies}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2.75cm} | p{14cm} }
Infrastructure & I use tools like Terraform and CloudFormation to
construct all my infrastructure from day one. \\
AWS & I have used Amazon Web Services to power large-scale crawlers and analysis
pipelines. \\
Databases & Primarily worked with PostgreSQL and variations of SQL
databases. In addition I also made heavy use of PrestoDB and DynamoDB.\\
Hadoop & Created and maintained applications on top of Apache Flink,
Apache Spark and YARN.\\
CI/CD & Experience in setting up the software, process and tooling needed
to continuously test and deploy services and products.\\
Docker & Experience packaging services to be used with Docker and
integrating Docker into the build process.
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Interests \& Focuses}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2.75cm} | p{14cm} }
  Metrics & What isn't measureable isn't actionable. I add metrics and logs to
any service I write, as well as supporting infrastructure like dashboards and
log aggregation. \\
Systems Design & I design systems for failure, which results in simple,
but reliable architectures, easy to maintain and expand.\\
Tooling & I am very fond of having good tools to work with, and will create and
maintain tools that enable and simplify future changes. \\
