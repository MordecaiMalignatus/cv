% Thomas' Suggestions:
% - Add "executive summary" to aid CTOs reviewing CVs, detailiing:
%   - How I got to where I am now
%   - What I do right now.
%   - What my personal interests are for programming.
%   - Rename Systems Design to Systems Architecture

\section*{Skills and Experience}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{PriceHubble}, Site Reliability Engineer, \textbf{November 2020 {\textendash} Current}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Maintained and developed tools for a large-scale Kubernetes
      cluster. This served as the basis of infrastructure to product teams.
    \item Started a cultural shift towards developer empowerment and autonomy,
      away from a classic Ops/Dev split. The incentives and final structure were
      modelled after the classic SRE literature.
    \item Transitioned company to new BI infrastructure based on GCP's
      BigQuery.
  \end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ryte}, Backend Software Engineer, \textbf{May 2017 {\textendash} Sep 2019}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Maintained a Scala web crawler central to the company,
        distributed over YARN and Flink, analyzed by a Scala service
        written in Spark. This system is running on AWS EMR, and was
        subsequently improved to support Javascript rendering and crawling
        single-page applications by controlling Chromium.
      \item Planned and implemented a personal development programme for
        engineering, involving space for self-directed learning,
        opportunity to conduct R\&D. This led to a number of useful tools
        being developed.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection*{Technologies}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2.75cm} | p{14cm} }
  Infrastructure & As much as I can I rely on Infrastructure as Code, through
                   whatever tool is most appropriate, for example Terraform,
                   CloudFormation, Helm Charts, ConfigConnector or the Google
                   Deployment Manager. \\
  Kubernetes & I have maintained and developed for several clusters. Istio and
               Helm were also used.\\
  Platforms & I have used AWS and GCP to power large-scale crawlers, analysis pipelines and ML
              training clusters. \\
  Databases & Primarily worked with PostgreSQL and variations of SQL
              databases. In addition I also made heavy use of BigQuery and DynamoDB.\\
  CI/CD & Experience in setting up the software, process and tooling needed
          to continuously test and deploy services and products.\\
  Programming Languages & Confident engineering skills in in Python, Scala, Rust and Elixir.
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Interests \& Focuses}
\begin{tabular}{ p{2.75cm} | p{14cm} }
  Observability & Modern, complex systems are hard to grasp and harder to change
                  successfully, and so having insight into what is happening in production is
                  invaluable. I build systems as transparent and observable as I
                  can. \\
  Systems Design \& Resilience & I design systems for failure, which results in simple,
                                 but reliable architectures, easy to maintain and expand.\\
  Tooling & I am very fond of having good tools to work with, and will create and
            maintain tools that enable and simplify future changes. \\
