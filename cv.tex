% Thomas' Suggestions:
% - Add "executive summary" to aid CTOs reviewing CVs, detailiing:
%   - How I got to where I am now
%   - What I do right now.
%   - What my personal interests are for programming.
%   - Rename Systems Design to Systems Architecture

\section*{Skills and Experience}

\subsection*{Programming Languages}
\begin{tabular}{ l p{14cm} }
Scala & Go-to language for implementing services, specifically the Typelevel ecosystem;
also \linebreak possessing experience of Akka-HTTP.\\
Python & Proficiency in building robust services and rapid prototyping,
experience in basic machine learning (Gensim/Keras), and data science.\\
Elixir/OTP & Experience in building highly-available services to be used as
building blocks in an \linebreak infrastructure; also some experience using Phoenix as
web-development backend.\\
Haskell & Experience in building correct libraries and algorithm
implementations, and using it for prototyping and subsequent scaling.\\
Rust & Experience in creating CLI tools that do specific, small things well, as
well as agents/daemons for metrics. Also created a desktop application using
Rust and {\tt web-view} \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Technologies}
\begin{tabular}{l p{12cm} }
Metrics & What isn't measureable is not actionable. Before we can change/correct
anything, we need metrics.\\
Infrastructure \linebreak automation & I use tools like Terraform and CloudFormation to
construct all my \linebreak infrastructure from day one. \\
Amazon Web Services & I have used AWS in a professional setting to construct, load-balance and
\linebreak maintain complex, distributed services. \\
Databases & I have primarily worked with PostgreSQL and variations of SQL
databases. I have also used NoSQL databases like Redis. \\
CI/CD & I have experience in setting up the software, process and tooling needed
to continuously test and deploy services and products.\\
Docker & I have experience packaging services to be used with Docker and
integrating Docker into the build process.
\end{tabular}

\subsection*{Interests \& Focuses}
\begin{tabular}{l p{12cm}}
Functional Programming & I take cues and ideas from maths in order to reduce the
amount of bugs and complexity in my code.\\
Systems Design & I design systems I build for failure, which results in simple,
but reliable \linebreak architectures, easy to maintain and expand.\\
Tooling & I am very fond of having good tools to work with, and will create and
maintain tools that simplify work to be done. \\

\section*{Employment}

\begin{itemize}
\item Backend Software Engineer at Ryte, 2017 {\textendash}
  present.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Working in an agile team developing Scala microservices.
            \item Conducted R\&D in a small team, developing algorithms,
              libraries and prototypes for the company in a variety of languages
              and technologies, where I used machine learning (Gensim/word2vec)
              to categorize and improve website content.
            \item Maintained a scala web crawler central to the company,
              distributed over YARN and Flink, the outpout of which is analyzed
              by a Scala service written in Spark, running on AWS EMR.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Open-source work and self study}

\begin{itemize}
  \item {\tt logrs} \href{https://github.com/MordecaiMalignatus/logrs}{(Github)}
    \begin{packed}
      \item Created to keep track of what was done during a day, for easy status
        reports and updates, as well as a way of recapturing of what was
        achieved. These notes are then grouped by day and archived in a central
        location.
    \end{packed}
  \item{\href{https://github.com/MordecaiMalignatus/path-of-beancounting}{Path
      of Beancounting}}
    \begin{packed}
    \item Light-weight desktop application for the game Path Of Exile, which
      gathers statistics from various sources, and displays them to the
      user. Most of it is written in Rust, while the front-end is written in
      {\tt web-view} with {\tt react.js}.
    \end{packed}
  \item Currently working through \href{http://haskellbook.com}{\emph{Haskell From First Principles}}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Education}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Incomplete B.Sc. Computer Science, Technical University of Munich (2016
    {\textendash} 2018)

  \item Abitur (A-levels), Asam Gymnasium, Munich
	\begin{packed}
	\item Average Grade: 2.8
